# blog-up

## Introduction
Blog-up is a simple blogging app where people can view blog posts.
They can choose to log in and write a blog themselves or leave a comment on other people's blogs.

## Motivation
This project was created because I wanted to leave notes on the various subjects that I was learning.
I find that making my own notes really help with retaining material and while Google Docs is useful, I wanted something of my own.
So I went ahead and built this with Java Spring, Thymeleaf, and MySQL. It is hosted on AWS (link below).

## Note
The website is still work in progress. UI could be significantly improved (currently underway).
Multiple other features could be added, but at this moment, they are not the top priority.
